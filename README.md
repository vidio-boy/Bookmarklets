I did not code all of the Bookmarklets; I got some of them off of Game Sites on Google Sites

<canvas id="myCanvas">
Your browser does not support the canvas tag.
</canvas>

<script>
var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
ctx.fillStyle = "#FF0000";
ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 80, 80);
</script>
